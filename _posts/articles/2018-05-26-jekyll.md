title: Adapting the Jekyll Theme `jekyll-theme-simple-blog`
tags: ["Jekyll", "simple blog theme"]
---

I really am into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a lot though sometimes, it gets confusing since I don't really know Ruby (yet). Lately, I have been into the Cayman themes modified by [Lorenzo P](https://lorepirri.com/index.html) and now, I've now adapted his [Simple Blog Theme](https://github.com/lorepirri/jekyll-theme-simple-blog). Previously, the theme of this site was the [Cayman Blog Theme](https://github.com/lorepirri/cayman-blog). 

Getting started with Jekyll for creating a static website for blogging is now a little bit easier with the availability of really great tutorials like the [one by Giraffe Academy](http://www.giraffeacademy.com/static-site-generators/jekyll/). 

How I used the jekyll-theme-simple-blog was a little hacky, but I was able to adapt it. The reason why I like this theme is that the links open up to a new page instead of in the same window. However, I didn't need the language translation, so I had to remove it. The same for the Facebook plugin. I'm looking forward to make more modifications to this theme.
