I'm Alona Varshal, a chemist by training. I started coding with Python in 2016, after learning about data science. I thought that it's an interesting field, having previously worked on pattern recognition using chemical sensor arrays where I used statistical tools like principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (a.k.a. machine learning). Previously, I worked on projects that involve dendrimers, enzyme inhibitors, enzyme immobilization and even delignification, aside from chemical array sensing I mentioned above. After tinkering with data science topics, I found that I actually enjoy building. I learned about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Special thanks to the creator of this theme, [Lore Pirri](https://lorepirri.com/index.html). The repo for this theme is [here](https://github.com/lorepirri/jekyll-theme-simple-blog).


So now, I am pursuing software development.

I currently live with my husband and yellow lab in the Austin, TX area.
