I'm Alona Varshal, a chemist by training. I started coding with Python in 2016, after learning about data science. I thought that it's an interesting field, having previously worked on pattern recognition using chemical sensor arrays where I used statistical tools like principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (a.k.a. machine learning). As a chemist, I previously worked on projects that involve dendrimers, enzyme inhibitors, enzyme immobilization and even delignification, aside from chemical array sensing I mentioned above. While learning Python, I found out about [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/){:target="_blank"} and learned that I actually enjoy building.

Eventually, I decided to learn JavaScript, which led me to go to a coding bootcamp ([Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/){:target="_blank"}). Some of the technologies I now dabble with, in addition to those I mentioned above, are Node.js, Express, PostGreSQL, React, and Redux.  I hope to get a job that uses my skills as a chemist and as a software developer. 

I have also been really into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}; hence, my choice of technology in building this personal site. Special thanks to the creator of this theme, [Lore Pirri](https://lorepirri.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}. The repo for this theme is [here](https://github.com/lorepirri/jekyll-theme-simple-blog){:target="_blank"}.

I currently live with my husband, Tom, and our dog, [Pogi](https://pogisadventureworld.com/){:target="_blank"}, in the Austin, TX area. We like to visit Colorado to camp and hike.
